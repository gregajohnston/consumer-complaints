# Consumer complaints

## Introduction

This program pulls public data from CFPB about consumer complaints against companies, specifically December 2014. Using a Jupyter notebook program, several basic data counts are taken that describe the shape of the data.

## Execution

There is nothing needed to run the code, except a Jupyter notebook. Simply open a notebook and run the code as it is listed in order by pressing <Shift> + <Enter>.

## Dependancies

This program relies on a few basic libraries for the Python language. Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib make up the core of the program, along with the Jupyter notebook. A requirements.txt file has been provided that can be run in the terminal to download and install any programs needed.
